# cv_toy
cv toys / validation on models
implementation of different models on mxnet (with python or c++ api).

## basic models

### generative adversarial networks for hand writing digits generation

basic GAN for hand writing digits from mnist dataset

## semantic segmentation

TODO

## object detection

### Yolo v3

Yolo v3, implemented in MxNet and TensorFlow.
TensorFlow version add IoU and GIoU as loss function.

## classification

TODO

## optical character recognition

TODO

## saliency detection

### light-weighted saliency detection

Light weighted saliency detection with effort to reduce both modle size and runtime memory, implemented in Pytorch and MxNet.

### deepfix

VGG16 backbone and inception module + dilation conv at output layers, implemented in Pytorch

### salgan

Generative Adversarial Nets for saliency prediction. Using GANs for saliency prediction is kind of nonesense, but implemented anyway, in Pytorch.
